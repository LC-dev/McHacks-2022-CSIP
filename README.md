McHacks 9: Covid Stringency Index Predictor

Authors: Paul Hinta, Lynn Cherif, Alexander Becker, Abdullatif Hassan

## Description: 
Balancing between public health and normal life has been a challenge policymakers have been facing during the COVID-19 Pandemic for the past 2 years. This tool provides a way to determine the level of public health measures required to curb the spread of COVID-19 given a set of public health data (daily cases, hospitalizations, deaths...). CSIP uses decision trees as part of a machine learning model that is trained on data from the 'Our World In Data' COVID-19 Dataset.
